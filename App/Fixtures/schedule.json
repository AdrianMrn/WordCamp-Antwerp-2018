We will look at the end to end workflow - from a single commit on github triggering continuous builds and tests, to the final, signed app distributed to testers, clients or end users. From monitoring services like JavaScript enabled crashes to understanding user behavior with analytics, we will look at ways to get better mobile apps to your users. We will look at the internals of Mobile Center to use with your existing toolchain, other services that are planned as a part of the suite, and integration with popular community tools and services.",
