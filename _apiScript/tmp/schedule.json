            "description": "<p>The Customizer is a great tool to live preview changes to a WordPress site. And it is becoming even more: what about a staging environment or a real WYSIWYG experience for editing content?<br />\nIt is time to benefit from what the Customizer has to offer. In this presentation I will try to give some examples of how you as a web developer as well as your client or user can take advantage from well-known and less well-known features of the Customizer. You can offer your users/clients controlled flexibility and ease of use when customizing their site and at the same time benefit from the available features with regard to long-term support and client satisfaction.</p>\n",
